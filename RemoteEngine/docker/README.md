## Limitations
1. The script might not work on Apple `M` processors as it runs x86 software via an emulation layer.
2. The script is not tested on Windows OS.

## Pre-Requisites
1. If you are specifically deploying a remote engine for IBM Cloud, you must have DataStage provisioned on IBM Cloud with an `Anywhere` plan. You can see different plans with details on https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/datastage.
1. Software that must be installed on the system.
    1. `docker` or `podman`
    1. `jq`
    1. `git` (optional)
1. You must have atleast 50GB of free space in `/var` in order to deploy the engine container. 200GB of free space is recommended.
1. You must have at least 2 cores and 4 GB memory, recommended is 4 cores and 8 GB memory, or more.
1. Recommended OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 8.8, 8.10, 9.2 and 9.4), Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, 24.04).
1. Ensure that the virtual machine allows outbound traffic to the following URLs:
    1. icr.io
    1. If you are specifically deploying a remote engine for IBM Cloud:
        1. iam.cloud.ibm.com
        1. dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com and api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com - if using Dallas datacenter
        1. eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com and api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com - if using the Frankfurt data center
        1. au-syd.dai.cloud.ibm.com and api.au-syd.dai.cloud.ibm.com - if using the Sydney data center
        1. ca-tor.dai.cloud.ibm.com and api.ca-tor.dai.cloud.ibm.com - if using the Toronto data center
        1. cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud (the url could have a prefixed region eg. <region>.s3.cloud-object-store.appdomain.cloud), so recommendation is to allow `*.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud` to accomodate such variations.


## Requirements
1. Clone this repo on the Remote Engine server: `git clone https://github.com/IBM/DataStage.git`.
    1. If you already have this repo cloned, go to the root directory and run `git pull` to get the latest changes.
1. If you are specifically deploying a remote engine for IBM Cloud, specify your IBM Cloud API Key. The API key is required for registering the remote engine to your Cloud Pak for Data project on IBM Cloud. To generate a new API key (https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui), open https://cloud.ibm.com in your browser.
    1. Click Manage > Access (IAM). Then, on the left side menu, select "API Keys" to open the "API Keys" page (URL: https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).
    2. Ensure that My IBM Cloud API keys is selected in the View list.
    3. Click Create an IBM Cloud API key, and then specify a name and description.
       * Note: Once you close this pop-up window, you will not be able to access the value of this API Key again.
1. Your Encryption Key and IV. These can be generated by executing the command
    ```bash
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -k secret -P -md sha1 -pbkdf2
    ```
    Sample output:
    ```
    $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -k secret -P -md sha1 -pbkdf2
    salt=5334474DF6ECB3CC
    key=2A928E95489FCC163D46872040B9B24DC44E28A734B7681C8A3F0168F23E2A13
    iv =45990395FEB2B39C34B51D998E0E2E1B
    ```
    From this output, the `key` and `iv` are used as the Encryption Key and initialization vector (IV) respectively.
1. Your Project ID(s). This is the comma separated list of IDs of the projects on Cloud Pak for Data project that you want to use with this Remote Engine instance whether it is for IBM Cloud or CP4D. (If you are using the DataStage in Frankfurt data center then please use https://eu-de.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com. If you are using the DataStage in Sydney data center then please use https://au-syd.dai.cloud.ibm.com. If you are using the DataStage in Toronto data center then please use https://ca-tor.dai.cloud.ibm.com.). You can retrieve this value by opening the project that you want to use with this Remote Engine and selecting the Manage tab > General to view the Project ID.
1. If you are specifically deploying a remote engine for IBM Cloud, the IBM Cloud Container Registry API Key. This API key will be used to download the images needed to run Remote Engine for IBM Cloud. Currently, clients need to request this API Key once they have provisioned a DataStage-aaS Plan and it needs to be requested via IBM Cloud Support: https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport.
1. If you are specifically deploying a remote engine for CP4D, the IBM Entitlement API key. This API key will be used to download the images needed to run Remote Engine for CP4D. Please follow https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/5.0.x?topic=information-obtaining-your-entitlement-api-key for instructions on how to obtain your IBM Entitlement API Key.

## Usage

### 1a. Start an engine on the Remote Engine server for IBM Cloud
The `dsengine.sh` script can be invoked from the `docker` folder of this project. Note that the name in the below command can be changed from `my_remote_engine_01` to your preferred name.
```bash
# create/start a local remote engine instance for IBM Cloud
./dsengine.sh start -n 'my_remote_engine_01' \
                    -a "$IBMCLOUD_APIKEY" \
                    -e "$ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
                    -i "$ENCRYPTION_IV" \
                    -p "$IBMCLOUD_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_APIKEY" \
                    --project-id "$PROJECT_ID1,$PROJECT_ID2,$PROJECT_ID3,..."

```
Once the script execution has completed, this engine needs to be selected in the project settings by going to the project, navigating to `Manage` > `DataStage` and selecting the appropriate engine under the `Settings` tab > `Remote` environments.
### 1b. Start an engine on the Remote Engine server for Cloud Pak for Data Instances
The `dsengine.sh` script can be invoked from the `docker` folder of this project. Note that the name in the below command can be changed from `my_remote_engine_01` to your preferred name.
```bash
# create/start a local remote engine instance for CP4D instance
./dsengine.sh start -n 'my_remote_engine_01' \
                    -e "$ENCRYPTION_KEY" \
                    -i "$ENCRYPTION_IV" \
                    -p "$IBM_ENTITLED_REGISTRY_APIKEY" \
                    --project-id "$PROJECT_ID1,$PROJECT_ID2,$PROJECT_ID3,..." \
                    --home "cp4d" \
                    --zen-url "CP4D_ZEN_URL" \
                    --cp4d-user "CP4D_USERNAME" \
                    --cp4d-apikey "CP4D_API_KEY"

```
Once the script execution has completed, this engine needs to be selected in the project settings by going to the project, navigating to `Manage` > `DataStage` and selecting the appropriate engine under the `Settings` tab > `Remote` environments.

#### Optional start flags

While starting a remote engine, following optional flags can be used in addition to the ones shown above. These can be seen via the help flag on the start subcommand: `./dsengine.sh start --help`.

1. `--memory <value>`: Sets the maximum amount of memory the engine can use. The value takes a positive integer, followed by a suffix of m/M, g/G, to indicate megabytes or gigabytes. Default is `4G`.
1. `--cpus <value>`: Sets the maximum amount of cpu resources the engine can use. The value takes a positive number. Default is `2` cores.

        * ENABLE_DS_METRICS - Set to "true" to have the remote engine send metrics to a configured DataStage metrics repository. See the [IBM Cloud](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/dstage/dsnav/topics/ds_metrics.html?context=cpdaas&audience=wdp) or [Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.1.x?topic=administering-storing-persisting-metrics) documentation for more information.


### 2. Update an engine

Update the remote engine instance to a new version. The update command gathers information from the existing docker container, then stops the existing container, removes it and spins up a new container with the same name. Hence a container must be running prior to running the the update command. You can simply re-run the start command that you started the container with.

```bash
# this will update the container with name 'my_remote_engine_01'
./dsengine.sh update -n "my_remote_engine_01" \
                     -p "$IBMCLOUD_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_APIKEY"
```

#### Optional update flags

1. `--security-opt <value>`: Specify the security-opt to be used to run the container.
1. `--cap-drop <value>`: Specify the cap-drop to be used to run the container.
1. `--additional-users <IBMid-1000000000,IBMid-2000000000,IBMid-3000000000,...>`: Comma separated list of ids (IAM IDs for cloud, check https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-identity-overview for details; uids/usernames for cp4d) that can also control remote engine besides the owner.
1. `--proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy_ip>:<port>`: Specify a proxy URL. The username and password can be skipped based on how the proxy is configured.
1. `--proxy-cacert <cacert location>`: Specify the location of the custom CA store for the specified proxy - if it is using a self signed certificate.

1. `--krb5-conf-dir <krb5-config-dir location>`: Specify the directory of multiple Kerberos config files if using Kerberos Authentication. (Only supported with --krb5-conf, the krb5.conf file needs to include "includedir /etc/krb5-config-files/krb5-config-dir" line).
1. `--import-db2z-license <DB2Z license location>`: Specify the location of the DB2Z license to import.
1. `--registry`: Custom container registry to pull images from. Must also set -u and -p options to login to the registry as well as either --digest or --image-tag for IBM Cloud.
1. `-u | --user`: User to login to a custom container registry (required if --registry is set).

### 3. Stop an engine

Stop the remote engine container.
```bash
# stop a local remote engine instance with name 'my_remote_engine_01'
./dsengine.sh stop -n 'my_remote_engine_01'

```
Note that if the `./dsengine.sh start` is used when a container is stopped, the script will simply start the stopped container.

### 4a. Cleanup/Uninstall a remote engine for IBM Cloud
This is NOT needed use this if you want to update the engine. This is only needed if you want to completely remove the engine container, delete the volume directories and deregister the remote engine from the associated project.
```bash
# cleanup a remote engine instance with name 'my_remote_engine_01'
./dsengine.sh cleanup -n 'my_remote_engine_01' \
                      -a "$IBMCLOUD_APIKEY" \
                      --project-id "$PROJECT_ID"
```
### 4b. Cleanup/Uninstall a remote engine for Cloud Pak for Data Instances
This is NOT needed use this if you want to update the engine. This is only needed if you want to completely remove the engine container, delete the volume directories and deregister the remote engine from the associated project.
```bash
# cleanup a remote engine instance with name 'my_remote_engine_01'
./dsengine.sh cleanup -n 'my_remote_engine_01' \
                      --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" \
                      --home "cp4d"
```

### Logs
#### Container-level logs
   * Location: Stored under /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/... on the host.
   * Purpose: Captures minimal container-level output (stdout/stderr) and can be accessed using podman logs <container-name>. (this is often empty or non-critical)
#### Primary Remote Engine logs
   * Initial Location: Typically written to /logs directory on the container and bind-mounted to /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/... on the host (by default).
   * Archived Location: Older logs are rotated and archived as ZIP files under /ds-storage/service_log_archive in the container, which is bind-mounted to <volume-dir>/ds-storage/service_log_archive on the host.
   * Purpose:
      * trace.log – Active detailed trace log of Remote Engine runtime (job interactions, service calls).
      * messages.log – Higher-level system logs (job polling activity, engine heartbeats, etc.).
#### Workload Management (WLM) logs
   * Location: Stored in /px-storage/PXRuntime/WLM/logs/ inside the container, bind-mounted to <volume-dir>/px-storage/PXRuntime/WLM/logs on the host.
   * Purpose: Captures CPU and memory usage metrics, job scheduling events, and system resource distribution among running DataStage pods.
#### Extracting Service Logs as Archive to Local Machine
   ```bash
   docker cp {container id}:/logs - > remoteenginelogs.tar
   ```

### Troubleshooting

1. Flow execution fails with incorrect host or IP Address in the log
If the script finishes succesfully, and you are able to see the engine in your project but the run still fails, you can check if container hosts file contains the host IP address. If so, you can remove the host IP address mapping so that the container uses 127.0.0.1 to resolve the hostname. This issue has been seen primarily when using podman. You can edit this file using the below steps
    1. Find the running container name or id using
       ```bash
       docker ps
       # OR
       podman ps
       ```
    1. Exec into the container:
       ```bash
       docker exec -it <container-name-or-id> bash
       # OR
       podman exec -it <container-name-or-id> bash
       ```
    1. Edit the hosts file inside the container
       ```bash
       nano /etc/hosts
       ```
    1. Remove the line that contains the IP address of the host and the host name
    1. Press `ctrl + x` to save and press `y` to exit from nano.
    1. Retry the flow.
Note that this fix will need to be re-applied whenever the current container is removed, eg. updating to a new image.

1. Making sure the URLs are allowlisted
For URLs mentioned in the [pre-requisites](https://github.com/IBM/DataStage/blob/main/RemoteEngine/docker/README.md#pre-requisites) section above, you can use ping from the host vm to make sure the URLs are accessible. Eg.
    ```
    $ ping api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com
    PING api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com (172.66.129.176) 56(84) bytes of data.

    ```

1. If the API Key Changes in DataStage aaS with Anywhere
If your API Key changes in DataStage aaS with Anywhere, you have to recreate the remote engine with the new API Key. In order to keep your remote engine with the same engine ID:
    1. Stop the remote engine container
    1. Remove/delete the remote engine container
    1. Run `dsengine.sh start` again with the new API key

1. Insufficient storage for the Remote Engine container image
   ```bash
   Error: writing blob: adding layer with blob "sha256:a8698704d0df7dd5be511fe1d9ed25f4801aa235b313cce295605a068bbf26c0"/""/"sha256:ac8a65b88f9323576d8c7978f45a3f1ea070f0d09a6428447fc8fd87eb5af13e": unpacking failed (error: exit status 1; output: open /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab: no space left on device)
   docker run return code: 125.
   ```
   Docker/Podman container storage layers, metadata, and volumes are stored in `/var` by default. It is recommended to have at least **50 GB** of free space in `/var` for installing the Remote Engine container image.
   
   Check the available storage:
   ```bash
   df -h /var
   ```
   Example output:
   ```bash
   Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   /dev/xvda4       8.8G 42.4G 52.8G 81% /
   ```
   #### Option 1: Clean up container storage
   To help cleanup used disk space within `/var`, run:
   ```bash
   podman system prune
   ```
   > [!IMPORTANT] This removes all unused images, including manually pulled ones.

   > [!TIP] Caution your client on the purpose of this command before executing.
   #### Option 2: Modify storage.conf
   Storage.conf is the configuration file that controls how container runtimes like Podman handle storage — particularly how and where they store images, layers, containers, and temporary files.
   ###### Part 1 - Mounting additional volumes
   If the customer has an additional volume that has been mounted already, then skip these steps.
   1. Check for the volume that needs to be mounted:
      ```bash
      lsblk
      ```
      Example output:
      ```
      NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
      xvda    202:0    0   10G  0 disk
      ├─xvda1 202:1    0    1M  0 part
      ├─xvda2 202:2    0  200M  0 part /boot/efi
      ├─xvda3 202:3    0  500M  0 part /boot
      └─xvda4 202:4    0  9.3G  0 part /
      xvdb    202:16   0   20G  0 disk 
      ```
      In this example, xvdb has 20GB needs to be mounted.
   1. Create a XFS file system to enable the mount:
      ```bash
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdb
      ```
   1. Make the new directory for container storage:
      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
      ```
   1. Mount the volume to the newly created root directory:
      ```bash
      sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mnt/data
      ```
   1. Verify the changes:
      ```bash
      df -h
      ```
      Expected Output:
      ```
      Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
      ...
      /dev/xvdb        20G  175M   20G   1% /mnt/data
      ```
   1. Persist the mount settings after reboot by adding it to the `/etc/fstab` file:
      ```
      /dev/xvdb /mnt/data xfs defaults 0 0
      ```
   ###### Part 2 - Creating the new directories for container storage
   Create the directory which will be used for container storage:

   If running Podman as rootful:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/containers/storage_root
   ```
   If running Podman as rootless:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
   ```
   > [!NOTE] If you're unsure whether the client is running rootful or rootless Podman, you can create both directories, just in case.

   When changing the location for rootful user's container storage on an SELINUX-enabled system:
   1. Verify if the customer has SELinux enabled:
      ```bash
      getenforce
      ```
      Output will be:
      - **Enforcing** → SELinux is active and enforcing policies
      - **Permissive** → SELinux logs but doesn't enforce
      - **Disabled** → SELinux is off
   1. If Enforcing, run these commands to translate the SELinux policies:
      ```bash
      sudo semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/containers/storage /mnt/data/containers/storage_root
      sudo restorecon -R -v /mnt/data/containers/storage_root
      ```
   1. For rootless containers, ensure ownership is granted to the rootless user:
      ```bash
      sudo chown -R amin:amin /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
      ```
    ###### Part 3 - Modifying storage.conf
   1. Edit the storage.conf file:
      ```bash
      sudo nano /etc/containers/storage.conf
      ```
      1. For rootful users, change the graphroot setting:
      ```
      graphroot = "/mnt/data/containers/storage_root"
      ```
   1. For rootless users, uncomment and modify the rootless_storage_path:
      
      Before:
      ```
      #rootless_storage_path = "$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage"
      ```
      After:
      ```
      rootless_storage_path = "/mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless"
      ```
   1. Verify the changes:
      ```bash
      podman info
      ```
      Expected output:
      ```
      store:
        ....
        graphRoot: /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
        ....
        runRoot: /run/user/1000/containers
        transientStore: false
        volumePath: /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless/volumes
      ```
   ##### Option 3: Symlink container storage to larger drive
   1. If necessary, add additional storage to the machine. Use the lsblk command to find the drive:
      ```bash
      lsblk
      ```
   1. Create a XFS file system:
      ```bash
      sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/vdc
      ```
   1. Make a directory for the symbolic link:
      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
      ```
   1. Mount the drive:
      ```bash
      sudo mount /dev/vdc /mnt/data
      df -h
      ```
   1. Change the owner of your new directory:
      ```bash
      sudo chown itzuser:itzuser /mnt/data
      ```
   1. Add to fstab for persistence:
      ```bash
      echo "/dev/vdc /mnt/data xfs defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
      ```
   1. Make a directory that we will symlink to:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p /mnt/data/containers
      ```
   1. Copy all data from existing containers directory:
      ```bash
      rsync -avP /var/lib/containers/ /mnt/data/containers/
      ```
   1. Backup the original directory:
      ```bash
      mv /var/lib/containers /var/lib/containers.old
      ```
   1. Create the symbolic link:
      ```bash
      sudo ln -s /mnt/data/containers /var/lib/containers
      ```
   1. Verify that it worked:
      ```bash
      cd /var/lib
      ls -ltr
      ```

1. Insufficient subgids/subuids for user namespace
   ```bash
   Error: writing blob: adding layer with blob "sha256:a9089747d5ad599b773f9bfca2a647fe03b75db371c637b5b650c96283e9a36e": processing tar file(potentially insufficient UIDs or GIDs available in user namespace (requested 1000321001:1000321001 for /home/dsuser): Check /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid if configured locally and run "podman system migrate": lchown /home/dsuser: invalid argument): exit status 1
   ```
   Starting the Remote Engine with rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a specific range of UIDs (1000321001) listed in the files `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.
   1. Install `shadow-utils`:
      ```bash
      sudo yum -y install shadow-utils
      ```
   1. Edit `/etc/subuid`:
      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/subuid
      ```
      Add:
      ```text
      etlpoc:100000:1001321001
      ```
   1. Verify the change:
      ```bash
      cat /etc/subuid
      ```
   1. Edit `/etc/subgid`:
      ```bash
      sudo vi /etc/subgid
      ```
      Add:
      ```text
      etlpoc:100000:1001321001
      ```
   1. Verify:
      ```bash
      cat /etc/subgid
      ```
   1. Apply changes:
      ```bash
      podman system migrate
      ```
   > [!TIP] Ensure the UID/GID ranges are properly configured and match across both files.

1. Insufficient 'cpu' and 'cpuset' permissions
   ```bash
   Error: OCI runtime error: crun: the requested cgroup controller `cpu` is not available
   ```
   On some systemd-based systems, non-root users do not have resource limit delegation permissions. This causes setting resource limits in rootless Podman to fail (for example, configuring the Remote Engine to have 8 cores).
   1. Log into the affected user.
   1. Verify if resource limit delegation is enabled:
      ```bash
      cat "/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers"
      ```
      Example Output:
      ```
      memory pids
      ```
   1. If cpu and cpuset are not listed, we need to add them to the .conf file:
      ```bash
      sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/
      sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf
      ```
   1. Modify the file:
      ```ini
      [Service]
      Delegate=memory pids cpu cpuset
      ```
   1. Persist the changes:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
      sudo systemctl daemon-reload
      ```
   1. Log out of the session and log back in to test the changes:
      ```bash
      cat "/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers"
      ```
      Expected Output:
      ```
      cpuset cpu memory pids
      ```
